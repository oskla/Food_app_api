# Food_app_api
 Food app
***

This application was made for android-phones, built in *Kotlin* with *Jetpack Compose*.  

I followed a figma-design and made API-calls to given endpoint. The purpose of the app is to fetch restaurant-objects and display them in a list. 
There is also a filtering function where every filter is fetched from a dynamic endpoint.
